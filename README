lhstat collects and outputs some properties of a running linux.

This is the first release, version 0.5, Sun Nov 02 01:32:44 GMT 2008

Writing this was a way to learn some Lisp basics for the first time,
and to solve the problem of monitoring some properties of my linux
laptops. I use it in the window manager Awesome v2.3.4, but, given its
text output, it shouldn't be too hard to reuse it in other window
managers, or textual environments. I've been using it on daily basis
for months on couple of different laptops.
